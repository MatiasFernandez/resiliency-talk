# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers: a minimum and maximum.

# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum; this matches the default thread size of Active Record.

  # processes).

  # before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
  # process behavior so workers use less memory.
